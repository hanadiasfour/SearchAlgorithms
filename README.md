# Round Table Seating Arrangement Optimization by Search Algorithms


This repository contains the implementation and analysis of three search algorithms—Greedy, UCS, and A*—applied to the round table seating arrangement problem. The goal is to minimize conflict by seating individuals with the lowest dislike percentages next to each other, and discover which search algorithm produces the best arrangement. 

The results and performance of the algorithms are analyzed in the report file attached.
